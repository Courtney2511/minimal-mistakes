**Assignment**:

Develop a RESTful Python/Flask application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

**Project Details**:  

Photobomb is a photo sharing application where users can upload a link to a photo along with a title and description for it, as well as associate the photo with a category.  Photos on the site can be viewed by anyone, but to be able to add a photo you must be a user.  Users can create an account either through the application, or through integration with Facebook Login.  Only photo owners can edit or delete the photo once it has been added to the site.

The project required that I implement one API endpoint for an arbitrary item in the catalog.  This inspired me to take the requirement a little bit further and serve all the item data from a python API application to be consumed by a React frontend application.  As I had no previous experience with React, this project as required that I self learn React along with Redux for state management.

**Technologies**:

* Python 2.7
* Flask
* React.js
* Redux
* HTML
* CSS

How Does This Help My Career?
Efficiently interacting with data is the backbone upon which performant web applications are built
Properly implementing authentication mechanisms and appropriately mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations are core features of a properly secured web application

**Reflection**:

Although making the decision to try out React for the frontend of the project meant that I spent a lot more time than I estimated to complete it, I am really glad that I decided to stretch the expectations of the project.   While self learning react for this project, I discovered a love for it, and out of a desire to learn more about best practices I enrolled in Udacity's React program which I am currently working on completing.
