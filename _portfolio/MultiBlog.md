**Assignment**:

Develop a Python blog app that supports multiple users with the ability to comment on others posts.  Users must be logged in to view and comment on posts.

**Project Details**:

MultiBlog is a basic multi-user blogging site that allows users to create accounts and then share blog posts.  Cookies are used for user authentication.  As an extra in the assignment, I added the ability for users to 'like' each others posts.

**Technologies**:
