**Project Details**:  

Aurora Newmarket Restaurants uses Google Maps API to map several restaurants in the area.  Users can select a restaurant from the list, or filter the list by input to select a restaurant.  Clicking on the locations marker will display an info window with location specific data from Facebook Places API including check ins and rating.


**Technologies**:

* Javascript
* Knockout
* Google Maps API
* Facebook Places API
* HTML
* CSS

How does this help my Career?
Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged
Asynchronous programming is important to understand in today's market

**Reflection**:

Although making the decision to try out React for the front-end of the project meant that I spent a lot more time than I estimated to complete it, I am really glad that I decided to stretch the expectations of the project.   While self learning React for this project I discovered a love for it, and out of a desire to learn more about best practices I enrolled in Udacity's React program which I am currently working on completing.
