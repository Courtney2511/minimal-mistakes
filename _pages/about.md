Hi Iâ€™m Courtney, sales professional turned developer.

Having recently completed Udacitys Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, I am currently looking for an opportunity as a Junior Developer where I can apply the knowledge I have acquired and continue to grow and expand my skill set.

I am a natural problem solver who loves to tackle challenges and believes in life long learning and continual personal development.

I have experience building projects with Ruby on Rails, Python/Flask, Javascript and React.
